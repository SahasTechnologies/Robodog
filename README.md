#### Controls
This project is controlled by an ESP32 connected to 4 servos and a OLED Display (along with many other componenets like resistors) to power the Robodog. It can be controlled through a webpage emitted via the ESP32 Wi-Fi signals Here is a schematic to make it clearer:

#### Body
The outer and inner shell are 3D printed and my screws are going to be from JLCMC.
